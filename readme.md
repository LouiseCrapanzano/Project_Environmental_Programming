# Water quality assignment
Satelitedata analyse van CHL trubidity en SPM om waterkwaliteit te beoordelen vd Schelde

1. **INTRODUCTION**

Water quality is a key issue in the field of water management because it directly affects the health of ecosystems and the well-being of communities dependent on freshwater resources. The advent of satellite technology has opened up new opportunities for monitoring and assessing water quality on a broader scale, providing us with valuable data and insights. In this assignment, you will be using **Sentinel-2 satellite imagery over the Scheldt river in Belgium**, a vital waterway in the heart of Europe. **Your task is to use Python's capabilities to develop a comprehensive water quality monitoring solution that focuses on key parameters such as chlorophyll-a, turbidity and suspended particulate matter**. By analysing these factors over time, you will aim to assess the progress and changes in water quality, contributing to the protection and sustainable management of this important aquatic ecosystem.
